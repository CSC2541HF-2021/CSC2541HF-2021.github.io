## Paper Summary Assignment
##### Due: TBA

In the paper summary assignment, you will select and summarize four papers of your choosing from the required reading list. In summarizing each paper, contextualize the paper within the research landscape, discuss the motivation and problem definition, the key approach of the paper - including the features that make it especially unique from other contemporary literature, and results/implications of the work for the medical - and medical machine learning - community.

Each summary should be roughly half a page using the provided LaTeX template. Some papers leave more to unpack and discuss than others, youâ€™re welcome to have some summaries which are longer, and some which are shorter - however, your entire submission is not to exceed two pages using the <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/neurips-2021/bfjnthbqvhgs" target="_blank">LaTeX template</a> (you do not need to include the title or authorship segments - since your name is included with your submission in Quercus - if you would prefer to omit them to save on space).

This assignment is to be submitted on Quercus.
